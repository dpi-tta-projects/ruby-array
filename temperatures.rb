# Goal:
#   Work with a list of recorded temperatures. Write a program that:
#     1. Prints how many temperatures are in the list
#     2. Prints the highest and lowest temperature
#     3. Prints the average (rounded to 2 decimal places)
#     4. Prints whether the last temperature is above, below, or equal to the average
#
# Example Output:
#   6 temperatures recorded
#   Highest: 79
#   Lowest: 65
#   Average: 71.33
#   The last recorded temperature (70) is below the average.
#

temperatures = [72, 68, 74, 79, 65, 70]
